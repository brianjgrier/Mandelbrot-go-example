# Mandelbrot golang/C++/C# example

This code is an example of how to use protocol buffers in multiple languages. I am targeting Golang for the server and Golang, C/C++ and C# for the client languages. 

The code is writen to be tested via the command line but also (will) include a Dockerfile to build a container for the server. publishing to Docker Hub will be done via CircleCI.
